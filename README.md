The objective of this project, part of our Analyzing Unstructured Data course, is to design a sentiment analysis system for Amazon reviews. Leveraging the principles and methodologies explored in class, our aim is to develop a system that accurately predicts the sentiment of reviews based on their textual content. This focus on Amazon reviews is driven by a personal interest in understanding consumer feedback and sentiment analysis. This decision led us to seek out a dataset that was rich in user reviews and sentiments, a key first step in the project. Selecting the right dataset was essential, as it would lay the groundwork for all subsequent analysis. Our aim in this exploratory phase is to delve into the nuances of user feedback on products, examining elements like sentiment trends, word usage patterns, and engagement levels. These insights will be crucial in crafting an effective sentiment analysis system, reflecting my chosen area of focus.
The heart of the project is the construction of the sentiment analysis system itself. This involves applying natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to predict the sentiment conveyed in review texts. Additionally, the system is designed to classify reviews into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral, enhancing the analysis process and allowing for more nuanced and accurate sentiment predictions. The model's success will be gauged by its accuracy in reflecting users' sentiments as expressed in their reviews.
Throughout the report, we will detail our approach to data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model development. We will also benchmark the performance of our model against standard metrics to ensure its
effectiveness. Additionally, we plan to review relevant literature, comparing our approach and findings with existing models and techniques in the field.
In the following sections, we will present a comprehensive narrative of my process in creating a sentiment analysis system for Amazon reviews, highlighting both the challenges encountered and the insights gained.
